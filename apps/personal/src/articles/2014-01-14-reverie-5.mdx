I just updated this website theme from Reverie 4 to Reverie 5 and wanted to make a quick post
reviewing this framework.

> **Edit:** This blog no longer runs on wordpress but on jekyll.

But first let’s starts with a little presentation. Reverie is basically
a WordPress Theme made with Foundation. Reverie 4 was made with Foundation 4, Reverie 5 is made
with Foundation 5 :-). This makes it a very responsive theme that you can easily customize.
[Here](http://themefortress.com/demo/) is what it looks like as a starting point.

To start with Reverie 5, you need to install all [foundation 5 tools](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html)
: Ruby, NodeJs, Bower, Grunt and Compass. This installation process has become a little more
complicated that it used to but it should still be pretty smooth.

Then, you copy the theme into your WordPress install and you are ready to go !
You will now need to customize all the PhP templates, the scss and probably the JavaScript.

On another point, the upgrade from Reverie 4 to 5 was pretty easy, tags didn’t change and scss
settings variables are still pretty much the same. I just had to update the WordPress function files,
the resource registration and injection and copy/paste template files. The way that I did it was the following :

- [Download](http://themefortress.com/reverie/) Reverie 5
- Update the functions.php file and the content of the /lib Folder
- Update the Scss
- Update the template files

If you get a blank page when upgrading it is probably that you are calling a PhP function that is
not declared yet. start by updating all resources in the lib Folder and the function files before
updating the template.
